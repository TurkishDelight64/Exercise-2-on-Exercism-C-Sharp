# Exercise-2-on-Exercism-C-Sharp
In this exercise, I am simulating a DND situation in which a hero saves a prisoner.

The scenario is that the hero has a pet dog with her and there is 1 guard and archer. Whether these characters are asleep or not affects if she can use her moveset.

The presence of the dog also affects whether if she can use some of her moveset.
